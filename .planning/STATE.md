# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)

**Core value:** A single chat message can trigger a verified, human-backed financial transaction — send money, bridge USDC cross-chain, or plan savings — all inside World App with proof-of-human identity.
**Current focus:** Phase 12 — send-crosschain

## Current Position

Phase: 12 (send-crosschain) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-05

Progress: [████████████████████] 8/8 plans (100%)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Component-first build order: agent infra must be proven before features are built on top
- 0G KV Storage over File Storage: KV supports mutable updates, no root hash tracking needed
- Two-model routing: GLM-5 for planning/advisory, DeepSeek V3 for fast tool execution
- Phase 6 (Mini App Shell) is a parallel frontend track — does not block backend phases
- [Phase 01]: Phase 1 uses static OG_API_KEY — @0glabs/0g-serving-broker and ethers deferred to Phase 2 for wallet-based on-chain auth
- [Phase 01]: @hono/node-server added as devDep with Node.js dynamic import fallback for environments without Bun runtime
- [Phase 01]: Classifier uses DeepSeek V3 for fast single-token classification (D-01); defaults to planning on any failure (D-02)
- [Phase 01]: stopWhen: stepCountIs(5) used over deprecated maxSteps — AI SDK v6 canonical API
- [Phase 01]: toUIMessageStreamResponse() over pipeDataStreamToResponse — Bun/Hono SSE compatibility
- [Phase 02]: prepare:false required for Supabase transaction pooler (port 6543) to avoid intermittent prepared statement failures
- [Phase 02]: drizzle-kit/api pushSchema.apply() must be called explicitly to execute DDL — pushSchema alone only plans changes
- [Phase 02]: KvClient.getValue returns Value object (data: Base64), not raw string — memory.ts reads result.data field
- [Phase 02]: Batcher flowContract passed as undefined with type cast — SDK auto-discovers flow contract via indexer
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: UserContext.memory is optional for backwards compatibility — assembleContext builds memoryStr inline when memory present
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: contextCache uses in-process Map with 30-min TTL — no external store needed for hackathon scope (D-08, D-09)
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: resolvedUserContext replaces stubUserContext in runAgent — stub preserved as fallback when no userId provided
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: Factory pattern for update_memory: each request gets own tool instance with userId + memory snapshot (not singleton)
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: update_memory only registered when userId present — anonymous users cannot persist memory
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: KV write failure returns success:false gracefully — never throws or breaks conversation flow (D-07)
- [Phase 03-identity]: isVerified and isHumanBacked both derive from user.worldId !== null — single source of truth in DB
- [Phase 03-identity]: nullifier_hash stored in users.worldId — no migration needed (column already nullable text)
- [Phase 03-identity]: invalidateContextCache called after successful verify — ensures isVerified propagates immediately without TTL delay
- [Phase 03-identity]: requireVerified returns null for pass, structured VERIFICATION_REQUIRED error for fail — Phase 4/5 gated tools import and call this guard
- [Phase 03-identity]: System prompt lists concrete gated actions (send money, debts, goals) and available actions so agent guides unverified users to World ID verify button
- [Phase 04-financial-ops]: Static import for @genie/db in confirm.ts ensures vi.mock() intercepts correctly in tests
- [Phase 04-financial-ops]: get_balance available to all users (ungated); resolve_contact and send_usdc require userId (DB + verification gate)
- [Phase 04-financial-ops]: Export chain from clients.ts; pass explicit account + chain to writeContract -- viem 2.45 requires both for non-narrowed wallet client types
- [Phase 04-financial-ops]: Deploy to World Chain (chain ID 4801) via forge script with broadcast
- [Phase 05-cross-chain-social]: XCHD-01 formally deferred -- cross-chain deposits not implemented, acknowledged in system prompt as coming soon
- [Phase 05-cross-chain-social]: Settlement notices injected into enrichedUserMessage before assembleContext -- context injection pattern D-10
- [Phase 06-mini-app-shell]: requestMiniKitPermissions uses walletAuth+getUserInfo: SDK Permission enum only supports notifications/contacts/microphone, not wallet-address
- [Phase 06-mini-app-shell]: ContactCard onContactSelect prop-drilled from ChatInterface so session and sendMessage are available without Context API
- [Phase 06-mini-app-shell]: add_contact tool has no verification gate -- saving contacts is ungated per plan spec
- [Phase 07]: resolveUserId accepts 0x wallet addresses and UUIDs — wallet addresses trigger upsert, UUIDs pass through unchanged
- [Phase 07]: verify route shares resolveUserId from chat module — single implementation for wallet-to-UUID resolution
- [Phase 07-api-wiring]: POST /api/users/provision created as HTTP endpoint — resolveUserId() is internal only; provision endpoint is the public-facing contract
- [Phase 07-api-wiring]: needsOnboarding = displayName.startsWith('0x') — wallet-derived name is proxy for no-real-name; avoids schema migration
- [Phase 07-api-wiring]: next-auth/jwt module augmentation removed — v5 beta does not export it; JWT fields use as-casts
- [Phase 07]: usersRoute reuses resolveUserId() from chat.ts — consistent wallet-to-UUID adapter across all routes
- [Phase 07]: Onboarding API call is non-blocking — failure does not prevent users from accessing the app
- [Phase 07]: REQUIREMENTS.md coverage count updated to Complete 18 / Pending 8 matching Phase 7 delivery state
- [Phase 07]: 07-03-PLAN requirements field reduced to [FOPS-04] only — MAPP-01/MAPP-02 were Phase 6 requirements included in error
- [Phase 10-onboarding-allowance]: ApprovalOverlay runs approval on mount via useEffect — no manual trigger needed after setShowApproval(true)
- [Phase 10-onboarding-allowance]: Budget amount is exact USDC units: BigInt(budgetUsd) * BigInt(1_000_000) — no infinite approval per D-03
- [Phase 11]: Balance route uses viem isAddress for wallet validation — consistent with existing codebase pattern
- [Phase 11]: useBalance memoizes fetchBalance with useCallback and exposes as refetch — enables post-send balance refresh
- [Phase 12-send-crosschain]: SendModal calls POST /api/send instead of triggerMiniKitPay — real backend integration
- [Phase 12-send-crosschain]: ConfirmCard URL fixed /confirm -> /api/confirm — one-line fix for silent over-threshold failure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- 36-hour deadline — ruthless prioritization required at every phase transition
- 0G Compute Adapter must be running at localhost:8000 before Phase 1 can be tested
- All code must be written during the hackathon (ETHGlobal rules — no pre-built code)
