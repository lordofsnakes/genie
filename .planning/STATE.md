# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)

**Core value:** A single chat message can trigger a verified, human-backed financial transaction — send money, bridge USDC cross-chain, or plan savings — all inside World App with proof-of-human identity.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — identity

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-04

Progress: [████████████████████] 8/8 plans (100%)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Component-first build order: agent infra must be proven before features are built on top
- 0G KV Storage over File Storage: KV supports mutable updates, no root hash tracking needed
- Two-model routing: GLM-5 for planning/advisory, DeepSeek V3 for fast tool execution
- Phase 6 (Mini App Shell) is a parallel frontend track — does not block backend phases
- [Phase 01]: Phase 1 uses static OG_API_KEY — @0glabs/0g-serving-broker and ethers deferred to Phase 2 for wallet-based on-chain auth
- [Phase 01]: @hono/node-server added as devDep with Node.js dynamic import fallback for environments without Bun runtime
- [Phase 01]: Classifier uses DeepSeek V3 for fast single-token classification (D-01); defaults to planning on any failure (D-02)
- [Phase 01]: stopWhen: stepCountIs(5) used over deprecated maxSteps — AI SDK v6 canonical API
- [Phase 01]: toUIMessageStreamResponse() over pipeDataStreamToResponse — Bun/Hono SSE compatibility
- [Phase 02]: prepare:false required for Supabase transaction pooler (port 6543) to avoid intermittent prepared statement failures
- [Phase 02]: drizzle-kit/api pushSchema.apply() must be called explicitly to execute DDL — pushSchema alone only plans changes
- [Phase 02]: KvClient.getValue returns Value object (data: Base64), not raw string — memory.ts reads result.data field
- [Phase 02]: Batcher flowContract passed as undefined with type cast — SDK auto-discovers flow contract via indexer
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: UserContext.memory is optional for backwards compatibility — assembleContext builds memoryStr inline when memory present
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: contextCache uses in-process Map with 30-min TTL — no external store needed for hackathon scope (D-08, D-09)
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: resolvedUserContext replaces stubUserContext in runAgent — stub preserved as fallback when no userId provided
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: Factory pattern for update_memory: each request gets own tool instance with userId + memory snapshot (not singleton)
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: update_memory only registered when userId present — anonymous users cannot persist memory
- [Phase 02-data-layer]: KV write failure returns success:false gracefully — never throws or breaks conversation flow (D-07)
- [Phase 03-identity]: isVerified and isHumanBacked both derive from user.worldId !== null — single source of truth in DB
- [Phase 03-identity]: nullifier_hash stored in users.worldId — no migration needed (column already nullable text)
- [Phase 03-identity]: invalidateContextCache called after successful verify — ensures isVerified propagates immediately without TTL delay
- [Phase 03-identity]: requireVerified returns null for pass, structured VERIFICATION_REQUIRED error for fail — Phase 4/5 gated tools import and call this guard
- [Phase 03-identity]: System prompt lists concrete gated actions (send money, debts, goals) and available actions so agent guides unverified users to World ID verify button

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- 36-hour deadline — ruthless prioritization required at every phase transition
- 0G Compute Adapter must be running at localhost:8000 before Phase 1 can be tested
- All code must be written during the hackathon (ETHGlobal rules — no pre-built code)
